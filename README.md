# 5G Network Slice Classification Using CNN

This project demonstrates the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify 5G network slices based on simulated data. It represents a practical application of deep learning in the domain of next-generation wireless networks.

## Slice Categories
The classification focuses on three core 5G functionalities:
- **eMBB** ‚Äì Enhanced Mobile Broadband  
- **mMTC** ‚Äì Massive Machine-Type Communications  
- **URLLC** ‚Äì Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications

##  Features

### üî¨ Synthetic Data Simulation
- Simulates 5G network metrics such as latency, throughput, signal strength, jitter, etc.
- Each sample is labeled with a slice category based on these metrics.

###  CNN Model
- A custom-built CNN model is trained to classify slices based on the synthetic data.
- Optimized for performance using TensorFlow/Keras.

###  Performance Visualization
- **Training Accuracy & Loss Curves**  
- **Confusion Matrix** for classification breakdown  
- **ROC Curves** with class-wise AUC scores  
- **Pair Plot with KDE** for feature distribution analysis  
- **Simulated Heatmap** showing resource utilization trends across slices
